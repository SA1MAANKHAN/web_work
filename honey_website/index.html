    <h2>Fighting infections</h2>
    <p>In 2010, scientists from the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam reported in FASEB Journal that honey’s ability to kill bacteria lies in a protein called defensin-1.

A more recent study in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases showed that a certain type of honey, called Manuka honey, can help prevent the bacteria Clostridium difficile from settling in the body. C. difficile is known for causing severe diarrhea and sickness.</p>
    </para>
    <para>
    <h2>Healing wounds and burns</h2>
    <p>There have been some cases in which people have reported positive effects of using honey in treating wounds.

A review published in The Cochrane Library indicated that honey might be able to help heal burns. The lead author of the study said that “topical honey is cheaper than other interventions, notably oral antibiotics, which are often used and may have other deleterious side effects.”

However, there is a lack of evidence to fully support this claim. In fact, a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases concluded that applying medical-grade honey to the wounds of patients has no advantage over normal antibiotics among patients undergoing dialysis.

Honey should never be given to young infants as it can cause botulism, a rare but severe type of food poisoning.</p>

    <h2>Relieving cold and cough symptoms</h2>
    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends honey as a natural cough remedy.

The American Academy of Pediatrics also recognizes honey as a treatment for a cough.

However, they advise that honey is not suitable for children under the age of one year.

A 2007 study by Penn State College of Medicine suggested that honey reduced night-time coughing and improved sleep quality in children with upper respiratory infection to a greater degree than the cough medicine dextromethorphan.</p>

    <h2>Replacing added sugar in the diet</h2>
    <p>Honey’s sweet flavor makes it an ideal substitute for sugar in the diet.

Added sugar in the diet provides excess calories with no nutritional benefit. This can lead to an increased body weight, which comes with an increased risk of high blood pressure and diabetes.

Honey can be added to food and beverages to sweeten the taste without the negative health impact of added sugars. However, since honey is still a sweetener, it is important to remain mindful of how much honey being is used.</p>

    <h2>Medicinal history of honey</h2>
    <p>Evidence from Stone Age paintings shows treatment of disease with bee product such as honey originated from 8000 years ago. Ancient scrolls, tablets and books-Sumerian clay tablets (6200 BC), Egyptian papyri (1900–1250 BC), Veda (Hindu scripture) 5000 years, Holy Koran, Bible, and Hippocrates (460–357 BC) illustrated that honey had been widely used as a drug.[17,18,19] Qur'an vividly indicated the activity of therapeutic value of honey.[20] The Lord has inspired the bees, to build their hives in hills, on trees, and in man's habitations, from within their bodies comes a drink of varying colors, wherein is healing for humankind, verily in this is a sign, for those who give thought. Although a number of papers have been published about honey, most of them have focused on the biochemical analysis, food, and nonfood commercial utilization. Honey was used for variety of disease conditions including eye diseases, asthma, throat infections, tuberculosis, thirst, hiccups, fatigue, dizziness, hepatitis, constipation, worm infestation, piles, eczema, healing of ulcers, and wounds in traditional medicine.</p>
    </para>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database, one tablespoon of honey contains 64 calories, 17.3 grams (g) of sugar, and 0 g of fiber, fat, and protein.

Choosing honey over refined and processed sugar may lead to long-term health benefits. Honey is known to have antioxidant, antimicrobial, and soothing effects.

It is made up of glucose, fructose, and minerals, such as iron, calcium, phosphate, sodium chloride, potassium, and magnesium.</p>
